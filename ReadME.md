## 🎯 Project Overview

This boilerplate serves as a solid foundation to kick-start your APIs with:

- **FastAPI**: Experience the speed and performance of one of the fastest Python web frameworks.
- **PostgreSQL**: Manage your data with the world's most advanced open-source relational database.
- **Jaeger**: Trace and monitor distributed systems with ease, ensuring you always know what's going on.
- **Docker**: Containerize your app for consistent and repeatable deployments across various environments.

## 🌐 Key Features

- **Scalability**: Utilizing FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities to handle high traffic loads.
- **Data Management**: PostgreSQL offers reliable ACID transactions and powerful querying.
- **Observability**: Integrated Jaeger tracing for detailed system performance insights.
- **Portability**: Docker guarantees your app runs without issues across different systems.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI 🐍
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 🗄️
- **Tracing and Monitoring**: Jaeger 👀
- **Containerization**: Docker 🐋

## 🔧 Getting Started

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fastapi-postgresql-jaeger-docker-boilerplate.git
cd fastapi-postgresql-jaeger-docker-boilerplate
```

Build and run your Docker containers:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Your FastAPI application should now be live at `http://localhost:8000`!

## 🛠️ Configuration

- **Environment Variables**: Customize your `.env` file for both local development and production environments. Set your database URLs, credentials, and other environment-specific settings to ensure seamless operations.
- **Jaeger Setup**: Connect your application seamlessly with Jaeger by configuring tracing in `config.yml`. Ensure you're capturing the right spans and logs to diagnose issues effectively.

## 🚀 Deployment

Deploy your application effortlessly using Docker. With pre-defined Docker configurations, promoting your app from development to production is smooth and efficient. Containerization ensures that your application behaves consistently across all environments. Explore cloud deployment options on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for scalable hosting.
